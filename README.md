# What is Git?

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.



## Version control

Version control systems generally allow users to revisit earlier versions of the files, compare changes between versions, undo changes, and a whole lot more.



{% hint style="info" %}
**Git helps us...**

Track changes across multiple files&#x20;

Compare versions of a project.&#x20;

"Time travel" back to old versions.&#x20;

Revert to a previous version.

Collaborate and share changes.&#x20;

Combine changes.
{% endhint %}

## Git is not Github

### Git

Git is the version control software that runs locally on your machine. You don't need to register for an account. You don't need the internet to use it. You can use Git without ever touching Github.

### Github

Github is a service that hosts Git repositories in the cloud and makes it easier to collaborate with other people. You do need to sign up for an account to use Github. It's an online place to share work that is done using Git.
